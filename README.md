# Deep-learning based GPA prediction using tabular and time series data

This notebook contains the preliminary (and incomplete) python coding to train the proposed model (kind of) for the following paper: Aggregating Time Series and Tabular Data in Deep Learning Model for University Studentsâ€™ GPA Prediction.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3088152   

Please read the paper to understand the context of the coding.

This notebook is not meant to recreate the results in the paper and I honestly put this here for my own documentation only. In fact, there are a lot of crucial stages that I intentionally omitted.

I also included a small csv file to provide a snippet of how the processed dataset for the paper looks like.
